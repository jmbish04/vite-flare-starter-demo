# Vite Client-Side Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# These variables are exposed to the browser (prefixed with VITE_)
# DO NOT put secrets here - they will be visible in the client bundle

# ============================================
# ElevenLabs Voice Agents (optional)
# ============================================
# Create agents at https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai
#
# Dynamic variables passed to agents:
#   - user_name, user_email (authenticated users)
#   - current_page, page_title (all users)
#   - entity_type, entity_name (on CRM detail pages)
#
# HOW TO UPDATE AGENTS:
#   1. Update BOTH .env AND .dev.vars with new agent ID
#   2. Rebuild: pnpm run build
#   3. Deploy: npx wrangler deploy
#   Note: VITE_* vars are baked into client at build time from .env

# Dashboard agent for authenticated CRM users
VITE_ELEVENLABS_DASHBOARD_AGENT_ID=

# Public agent for website visitors
VITE_ELEVENLABS_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=
